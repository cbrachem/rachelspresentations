\begin{frame}{What is PyNE?}

    PyNE is \textit{the} open source nuclear engineering toolkit.
    \vspace*{1em}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item PyNE is a \textit{library of composable tools} used to build 
    nuclear science and engineering applications
    \item It is \textit{permissively licensed} (2-clause BSD)
    \item It supports both a \textit{C++} and a \textit{Python} API
    \item The name 'PyNE' is a bit of a misnomer since most of the code 
    base is in C++ but most daily usage happens in Python
    \item \textit{v0.4} is the current, stable release
    \item As an organization, PyNE was born in April 2011 
    (however, core parts of PyNE have existed since 2007)

        To help nuclear engineers:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item be more \textit{productive} (don't reinvent the wheel!)
        \item have the best \textit{solvers}
        \item have a clear and useful \textit{API}
        \item write really great code
        \item \textit{teach} the next generation

%Python for Nuclear Engineering, or PyNE (http://pyne.io/), is a collaborative, open source project consisting of a collection of
%computational tools pertinent to nuclear engineering analysis and simulations.
%PyNE primarily provides a common Python interface for code written in C++,
%Python, and Fortran. This allows fundamental components of PyNE to easily be
%combined to form powerful and complex programs. These fundamental components
%include canonical nuclide and reaction naming conventions, material handling,
%nuclear data and cross-section reading, mesh operations, and
%physics-code-specific input and output parsing.
%
%This presentation will begin with a discussion about the background and philosophy behind PyNE and include a demonstration of how PyNE could be used in a project. I will also cover some of the current developments, with a focus of how I'm using PyNE as a tool for my research in computational methods for neutral particle transport.

\section{Demo}
\begin{frame}{What Can PyNE Do?}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Nuclear data and cross-section reading/processing
    \item Material handling
    \item Canonical nuclide and reaction naming conventions
    \item Mesh operations
    \item MCNP and Serpent input/output parsing
    \item Fuel cycle functionality (transmutation, enrichment)
    \item There's more, and the list continues to grow
    \end{itemize}
    
    The idea is to be able to easily combine components and avoid redeveloping
    utilities someone else has developed.

\section{Current initiatives}
\begin{frame}{What are we Working on Now?}

    The biggest push: orienting toward NQA-1 qualification \cite{pyne_vnv}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Adding theory descriptions for each piece
    \item Documenting our V\&V process
    \item Slowling removing the "VnVWarning: pyne.nucname is not yet V\&V compliant" as
    things become qualified
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace*{1 em}
    DAGMC and R2S development (\textcolor{cardinal}{Univ.\ Wisconsin})
    
    \vspace*{1 em}
    Plug-and-play solver research sandbox (\textcolor{byellow}{Berkeley})

\section{Get involved!}
\begin{frame}{Why Would I Get Involved?}

As a \underline{\textcolor{byellow}{\textbf{user}}} you could do your work or research with PyNE.  Even if you have your own software that looks and behaves similarly to some aspects of PyNE, using PyNE will mean that you no longer have to develop AND maintain that functionality.

\vspace*{2 em}
As a \underline{\textcolor{byellow}{\textbf{developer}}} you should be selfish.  Contribute to PyNE in ways that support the work that you are doing. If a feature you want is not in PyNE right now, chances are that other people want to see that feature too! This will help your future self as much as future other people.
